Knowledge-Base Q&A with RAG (FAISS + Hugging Face)

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that loads documents, chunks them, generates embeddings, and builds a FAISS vector index for semantic search. User queries are answered using relevant context retrieved from the knowledge base and an LLM (Llama 3.1 via Hugging Face Inference).
